# Dicoding-Image-Classification
# Rock-Paper-Scissors Image Classification using TensorFlow

This project is part of the final submission for the Dicoding Academy DBS Foundation Coding Camp 2024. The objective of the project is to create a neural network model using TensorFlow that can classify images of hands showing rock, paper, or scissors gestures. The project involves data preprocessing, augmentation, and model training, achieving an accuracy of at least 85%.

## Project Features
- **Dataset**: Rock-Paper-Scissors dataset from [this link](https://github.com/dicodingacademy/assets/releases/download/release/rockpaperscissors.zip)
- **Data Splitting**: 60% training set, 40% validation set
- **Data Augmentation**: Implemented using ImageDataGenerator
- **Model Architecture**: Sequential model with TensorFlow
- **Training Environment**: Google Colaboratory
- **Training Time**: Under 30 minutes
- **Accuracy**: Minimum 85%
- **Prediction**: Able to predict uploaded images
